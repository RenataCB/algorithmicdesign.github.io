                                <h2>About the project</h2>
                      
                                <p> Algorithmic approaches are currently being introduced in many areas of
                                human activity and architecture is no exception. However, designing with
                                algorithms is a foreign concept to many and the inadequacy of current
                                programming environments creates a barrier to the generalized adoption of
                                Algorithmic Design (AD). The Khepri.gh project aims to provide architects
                                with a programming tool they feel comfortable with, while allowing them to
                                fully benefit from AD&#39;s advantages in the creation of complex architectural
                                models.
                                <br /> 
                                Khepri.gh is a hybrid solution that combines Grasshopper, a visual
                                programming environment, with Khepri, a flexible and scalable textual
                                programming tool. Khepri.gh establishes a bridge between the visual and the
                                textual paradigm, offering its users the best of both worlds while providing
                                an extra set of advantages, including portability among CAD, BIM, and
                                analysis tools.

                        <h2>Implementation and Features</h2>

                        <p> Khepri.gh&#39;s implementation is in many ways similar to Grasshopper&#39;s currently
                        available textual scripting editors: (A) users drag a blank Khepri component
                        onto the canvas, (B) open up the editor box by double-clicking a component
                        and develop Julia code within; (C) they can then save the new components
                        onto a dedicated tab.
                        </p>

                        <div class="row"><div class="1u 12u"></div>
                        <div class="10u 12u"> 
                            <a href="kheprigh/basics.png" class="image
                            featured"><img src="kheprigh/basics.png" alt="" title="Khepri.gh's
                            implementation"></a>
                            </div></div>
                        
                        <p> However, while Grasshopper&#39;s C\#, VB, and Python scripting editors only
                        provide the features of each programming language unless other libraries are
                        loaded, our implementation not only integrates the Julia language but also
                        the Khepri programming tool from the start. This means, that besides the
                        language primitives, users have access to the modeling primitives available
                        in Khepri, which are transversal to the multiple backends.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Traceability</h4>

                        <p>Traceability entails the identification of which parts of the model
                        correspond to which parts of the program, and vice-versa, a crucial
                        correlation to understand, maintain, and debug the program. Khepri.gh
                        maintains Grasshopper’s unidirectional traceability, relating program
                        components to model elements but across multiple backends.
                        </p>
                         
                        <a href="kheprigh/traceability.png" class="image
                            featured"><img src="kheprigh/traceability.png" alt="" title="Traceability"/></a>
                        <br />

                        <h4>Immediate Feedback</h4>

                        <p>Immediate feedback is the ability to re-compute changes to the program’s
                        input or to the program itself in (near) real time, allowing designers to
                        easily understand the program’s behavior. Grasshopper immediately updates
                        the geometry upon adding/changing components, Boolean toggles or sliders.
                        Khepri.gh extends this feature to the various backends but performance must
                        be taken into consideration when dealing with complex models. Scale is
                        already an issue for Grasshopper’s optimized preview mode (i.e., non-baked
                        geometry); even more so for Khepri.gh, which has to generate the geometry in
                        the backends, a somewhat equivalent process to baking. This process is
                        considerably faster in more performative backends, such as game engines, or
                        using CAD tool’s more performative view options, such as wireframe models.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Code editing options</h4>

                        <p>Khepri.gh supports different code editing options. In the visual
                        programming environment, the user can (A) manipulate existing Grasshopper
                        components and (B) create new Khepri components, each one representing a
                        parcel of code, using the textual programming editor available within
                        Grasshopper. However, for more lengthier components, (C) the code can also
                        be accessed in a textual programming editor, such as Atom by right clicking
                        a component and choosing the ‘Khepri code’ option.
                        </p>

                        <a href="kheprigh/code_options.png" class="image
                        featured"><img src="kheprigh/code_options.png" alt="" title="Code editing options"/></a>
                        <br />

                        <h4>No Repetition</h4>

                        <p>Following Grasshopper’s native structure, VB, C\# or Python components
                        motivate the construction of standalone components which both implement and
                        execute operations. When reusing such components, the code is essentially
                        duplicated and further changes to that structure must be performed in all
                        similar components. Textual programming follows a different logic, where
                        repetition is avoided at all costs for logic and organizational purposes.
                        This makes the code structure more comprehensible and manageable, sparing
                        the user the time-consuming and error-prone task of maintaining several
                        versions of the same functionality. 
                        <br /><br />
                        Khepri.gh follows the textual logic in this issue, introducing a
                        fundamental separation between function definitions and function calls.
                        All components on canvas are processed on demand, with or without
                        inputs, with or without specific modeling instructions. Users may gather
                        function definitions, in one or more components, that can be used in all
                        the others that call them, thus eliminating repeated definitions. When
                        the user edits a definition component, the changes will have automatic
                        repercussions in any other components dependent upon this one.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Complexity</h4>

                        <p>The scalability issue inherent to visual programming languages affects
                        many of the features that make these systems so appealing to users in
                        earlier stages: both immediate feedback and program readability are
                        compromised as complexity increases. For the first issue, Grasshopper
                        cleverly offers a solution unsurprisingly inspired in the way textual
                        programming languages deal with geometry generation: inputting numbers
                        directly onto sliders instead of dragging them, or even disabling the solver
                        as we edit the program, thus significantly reducing the number of times the
                        model is recomputed. 
                        <br /><br /> For the second problem, the most obvious solution is
                        abstraction: the possibility to encapsulate complex computations in much
                        simpler program structures, such as recursive and iterative first-order or
                        higher-order functions. These mechanisms allow the development of more
                        complex programs without resorting to the repetition of instructions.
                        However, most visual programming languages, including Grasshopper, do not
                        (directly) support these functionalities. Since Khepri.gh is built on top of
                        the Julia language, any Julia functionality can be used from Grasshopper as
                        well, meaning that the data that flows between components includes not only
                        basic data structures, such as numbers and positions, but also functions,
                        arrays, tuples, dictionaries, etc., and arbitrary combinations of these.
                        </p>
